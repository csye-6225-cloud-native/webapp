## Packer - custom GCE image

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are installed and configured:

- Packer

### Configuration with pkrvars.hcl

To configure infrastructure for different environments (eg dev, stage, prod):

- Create a env.pkrvars.hcl file (eg, dev.pkrvars.hcl, prod.pkrvars.hcl, etc) in `/packer` folder
- Sample env.pkrvars.hcl file:
```hcl
    environment         = "dev"
    project_id          = "gcp project id"
    zone                = "gcp zone"
    ssh_username        = "xxxxxxx"
    db_user             = "xxxxxxx"
    db_password         = "xxxxxxx"
    source_image_family = "centos-stream-8"
    subnet_id           = "xxxxxxx"
    disk_size           = 20
    disk_type           = "pd-standard"
    instance_name       = "webapp-vm"
    machine_type        = "e2-medium"
    image_name          = "webapp-v1"
    image_family_name   = "webapp-centos-8"

``` 

### Steps to build custom image

- Navigate to the packer directory:
    ```sh
   cd packer
   ```

- Initialize packer workspace:
    ```sh
   packer init .
   ```

- Format configuration files:
    ```sh
   packer fmt .
   ```

- Validate configuration files:
    ```sh
   packer validate .
   ```

- Build custom image:
    ```sh
   packer build -var-file="env.pkrvars.hcl" gcp.pkr.hcl
   ```
